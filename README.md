## About Me

Hello! My name is Bryan Freedman, and I am a passionate and driven software engineer with a diverse background in entertainment, education, and advocacy. I recently transitioned into the tech industry after completing Tech Elevator's full-stack Java bootcamp, where I honed my skills in Java, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, Vue.js, HTML, CSS, and more.

My journey has always been guided by a desire to create solutions that are both functional and impactful, and I'm excited to bring that same energy to the tech world. Whether it's leading the development of user-friendly applications or collaborating across teams to ensure the best possible user experience, I am dedicated to making technology accessible and intuitive for everyone.
